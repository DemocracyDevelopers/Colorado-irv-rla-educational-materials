# Frequently Asked Questions about IRV RLAs with RAIRE

## Question 1: Will these audits be genuine Risk Limiting Audits?
Answer: Yes. IRV RLAs with RAIRE satisfy a risk limit, just like any other RLA. This limits the probability of mistakenly accepting a wrong outcome.

## Question 2: Will these audits require more ballot samples than plurality RLAs?
Answer: No. The number of ballot samples depends on the contest margin and the number of errors found during the audit. 
IRV RLAs with RAIRE require approximately the same sample size as plurality audits with the same margin and error rate.

Sometimes it is hard to understand the true margin of an IRV contest---if the IRV contest has a close comparison somewhere in the elimination 
sequence that makes a difference to the outcome, then RAIRE will identify that comparison and may require a lot of samples to audit it. This is
equivalent to a plurality contest with the same small margin.

## Question 3: Will the code be open source?
Answer: Yes. You can watch the development in our [Github repositories here](https://github.com/DemocracyDevelopers/). The final product will 
eventually be incorporated into [The Colorado RLA repositories](https://github.com/cdos-rla).
